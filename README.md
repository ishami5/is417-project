# is417-project
This project will look at twitter data andcreate a classifier in order to find attitudes on covid. 
We will see how, for example words like vaccine from a few thousand tweets how do we figure out they are getting more positive over time â€”> average the words and subtract the embeddings from the other categories. Then look at the cosine similarity to see how we define these words 
the Classifier to look at the tweets as a whole
